## [S2UNet] - Low-Light Image Enhancement

> **Note:** The source code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

### 📖 Overview

This repository will host the official PyTorch implementation of our paper:

> **Self-Supervised Unfolding Network with Shared Reflectance Learning for Low-Light Image Enhancement**

which is currently under review at *IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)*.

**Authors:**
Jia Liu, Yu Luo, Guanghui Yue, Jie Ling, Liang Liao, Chia-Wen Lin, Guangtao Zhai, and Wei Zhou

In this work, we propose a novel **self-supervised unfolding network**, termed **S²UNet**, for the task of **low-light image enhancement (LIE)**.

The proposed method integrates physical model unfolding with shared reflectance learning, enabling effective enhancement without reliance on paired ground-truth data.

### 📦 Dependencies


The implementation is based on **PyTorch**. The main dependencies include:

* Python 3.8.20
* Pytorch 2.4.1
* Other common libraries (NumPy, OpenCV, etc.)

A complete `requirements.txt` file will be provided upon code release.

### 🏃 Getting Started (After Release)

Once the paper is accepted and the code is public, you will be able to:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Download pre-trained models
4. Run test and evaluate
